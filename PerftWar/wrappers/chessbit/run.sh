# UCI wrapper around thuijbregts/chessbit.
#
# Chessbit is an interactive CLI tool with its own command set
# (`setfen <fen>`, `perft <depth>`, `exit`). PerftWar drives a UCI
# subset over stdin, so this wrapper translates per `go perft <n>` into
# a fresh chessbit invocation, feeding it the FEN + depth via stdin,
# then prints `perft-done` as the end marker.
#
# Per-call re-spawn means any internal state inside chessbit (if any)
# is fresh each call. Chessbit appears to be stateless besides the
# board position, so this is fine.

# chessbit's source lives in repo/chessbit/, and the install script
# leaves the built binary there as chessbit/chessbit. We can't lift it
# one level up because `bin/chessbit/chessbit` is the source dir name.
